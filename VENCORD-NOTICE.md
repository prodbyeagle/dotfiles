# UI Refresh Experiment Notice

I am currently participating in the UI Refresh Experiment on Discord.

Please be aware that some features and interfaces may appear different as a result of this experiment.

Experiments are unreleased Discord features. They might not work as expected, could potentially break your client, or
even disable your account. (There have been no reports of accounts being closed, so it seems relatively safe.)
